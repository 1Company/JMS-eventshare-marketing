## Post 1: The Problem

📸 **Your company event had 200 attendees. You got 15 photos.**

Sound familiar?

Here's what usually happens:
- The official photographer captures staged moments
- A few colleagues share 3 photos to the group chat
- Most people forget to share (or can't be bothered)

Meanwhile, hundreds of candid moments—the real memories—stay locked on phones forever.

There's a better way. (Link in comments)

## Post 2: The Solution

🎯 **What if every attendee could contribute photos in 30 seconds?**

No app downloads.
No account creation.
No friction.

Just a QR code that opens instantly.

At your next corporate event:
→ Display the QR code on screens
→ Attendees snap & upload from their phones
→ Photos appear live on the TV slideshow
→ You download everything at the end

200 attendees. 200+ photo opportunities.

That's the power of frictionless sharing.

## Post 3: Case Study Format

📊 **Conference photo engagement: Before vs After**

**Before EventShare:**
- Attendee photos shared: 12
- Time spent collecting: 2 weeks of follow-ups
- Photos actually received: Mostly blurry

**After EventShare:**
- Attendee photos shared: 340+
- Time spent: 2-minute setup
- Bonus: Live slideshow kept energy high all day

The difference? Removing every barrier between "I should share this" and actually doing it.

## Post 5: Behind the Scenes

🛠️ **Building EventShare: Why we bet on browser-first**

When we started, everyone said: "Make an app!"

We said: "Why add friction?"

Here's the reality:
- 73% of event attendees won't download an app for a single event
- Web apps load in 2 seconds
- Camera permissions = one tap

Result: Our upload rate is 3-5x higher than app-based competitors.

Sometimes the best product decision is removing what's unnecessary.
