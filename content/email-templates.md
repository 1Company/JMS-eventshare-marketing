## Template 1: Cold Outreach to Event Agencies

**Subject:** Quick question about your event photo collection

Hi [Name],

I came across [Agency Name] and noticed you've organized some impressive corporate events.

Quick question: How do you currently collect attendee photos from your events?

Most event coordinators tell me they struggle with:
- Getting people to actually share
- Collecting everything in one place
- Having photos for post-event marketing

We built EventShare specifically for this. It's a browser-based tool (no app downloads) that lets every attendee contribute photos via QR code. Photos appear live on a TV slideshow and are ready to download immediately after.

Would you be open to a 10-minute call to see if this might help your upcoming events?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. You can try it free for your next event - first 10 photos are on us. [Link]

## Template 2: Follow-up (3 days later)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your event photo collection

Hi [Name],

Just floating this back up in case it got buried.

I'd love to show you how EventShare helped [Company X] collect 340+ photos at their last conference (up from the usual 15-20).

Here's a 2-minute video showing how it works: [Link]

Worth a quick look?

## Template 3: Conference Organizer Outreach

**Subject:** Boost conference engagement (and content)

Hi [Name],

I saw [Conference Name] is coming up in [Month]. Exciting!

I wanted to share a tool that's been helping conference organizers do two things:
1. Keep attendee energy high with a live photo slideshow
2. Collect hundreds of authentic photos for post-event marketing

It's called EventShare - attendees just scan a QR code and upload. No app needed.

If you're interested, I'd be happy to set up a free trial for your event. Takes about 2 minutes to configure.

Let me know if you'd like to chat.

Best,
[Your name]

## Template 4: After Someone Signs Up (Nurture)

**Subject:** Getting the most out of EventShare at your event

Hi [Name],

Thanks for creating your event on EventShare! Here are 3 quick tips to maximize photo collection:

**1. Display the QR code prominently**
Put it on table tents, screens, or even name badges. The more visible, the more uploads.

**2. Announce it early**
Tell attendees: "Your photos will appear live on the big screen!" This gets people excited to participate.

**3. Turn on the slideshow**
When people see their photo appear, they share more. It creates a fun feedback loop.

Questions? Just reply to this email.

Good luck with your event!

P.S. Here's your event QR code again: [QR image]

## Template 5: Re-engagement (After Event)

**Subject:** How did [Event Name] go?

Hi [Name],

Hope your event went great last [day/week]!

Quick questions:
1. Did EventShare help you collect more photos than usual?
2. Any feedback on what we could improve?

If you've got another event coming up, we'd love to help again. Use code RETURNING for 20% off your next event.

Thanks for giving us a try!

Best,

## Template 6: Partnership Proposal (Venues)

**Subject:** Partnership idea for [Venue Name]

Hi [Name],

I run EventShare, a photo-sharing platform used at corporate events and conferences.

I've noticed [Venue Name] hosts a lot of corporate events. I wanted to propose a simple partnership:

**What we offer:**
- Free EventShare access for events at your venue
- Co-branded QR codes with your logo
- Priority support for your clients

**What we'd appreciate:**
- A mention in your event packages
- A small link on your website (events page)

This gives your clients an extra amenity at no cost, and helps us reach more event organizers.

Would you be open to a quick call to discuss?

Best,
[Your name]
